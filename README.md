# Whale Talk Translator App

## Overview

The Whale Talk Translator is a simple, fun application designed to translate any given input text into "Whale Talk", a whimsical language that consists only of vowels (A, E, I, O, U), with an emphasis on the letters E and U. When the input text contains the letters E or U, they are doubled to mimic the long, drawn-out sounds made by whales.

## Features

- **Input Text Translation:** Takes any string as input and translates it into Whale Talk.
- **Focus on Vowels:** Filters the input text to only include vowels (A, E, I, O, U).
- **Emphasis on E and U:** Doubles the occurrence of E and U in the translation for emphasis.
- **Case Conversion:** Converts the translated text into uppercase for a uniform appearance.

## Usage

1. **Input Preparation:** Prepare a text input that you want to translate into Whale Talk.
2. **Translation Process:**
   - The app iterates over each character in the input text.
   - It checks if the character is a vowel and includes it in the result.
   - If the vowel is E or U, it adds the vowel twice to the result array.
   - The app logs each step of the process for transparency.
3. **View Result:**
   - The resulting Whale Talk translation is joined into a single string and converted to uppercase.
   - The final translation is logged to the console.

## Example

Given the input text "turpentine and turtles", the app translates it to "UUUUEEIEEAUEE", mimicking the long, drawn-out sounds of whale communication.
